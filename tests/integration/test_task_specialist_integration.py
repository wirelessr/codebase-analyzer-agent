        EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY ANALYSIS:
        - Found Flask app structure in app.py with basic routing
        - User model exists in models.py with SQLAlchemy ORM
        - Database configuration present using SQLite
        - Templates directory with basic HTML structure
        - Static assets folder for CSS/JS
        
        INTEGRATION POINTS:
        - User model can be extended with authentication fields (password_hash, is_active)
        - Flask-Login can integrate with existing User model
        - Current route structure in app.py allows adding auth decorators
        - Database schema can accommodate auth tables via migrations
        
        IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
        1. Install Flask-Login and Werkzeug for password hashing
        2. Add authentication fields to User model (password_hash, last_login)
        3. Create login/logout routes with form validation
        4. Implement session management using Flask-Login's login_manager
        5. Add @login_required decorators to protected routes
        6. Create login/logout templates extending existing base template
        
        POTENTIAL CONFLICTS:
        - No conflicts detected with existing codebase structure
        - Current User model schema needs migration for new auth fields
        - Session configuration may need updating for security
        
        CODE PATTERNS FROM CODEBASE:
        - Existing routes follow pattern: @app.route('/path', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
        - Database models use SQLAlchemy declarative syntax
        - Templates use Jinja2 with base template inheritance
        - Error handling follows Flask's standard abort() pattern
        
        ARCHITECTURE COMPATIBILITY:
        - Flask app factory pattern not used (simple app instance)
        - SQLAlchemy models follow standard conventions
        - No existing middleware that would conflict with Flask-Login
        - Static file serving compatible with auth system
        
        DEPENDENCIES:
        - Flask-Login for session management (compatible with current Flask version)
        - Werkzeug for password hashing (already included with Flask)
        - No breaking changes to existing dependencies required
